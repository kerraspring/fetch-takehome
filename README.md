### Live App

## Challenges
    - Creating service files for API calls was not something I had done in the past. It was necessary because they were cluttering up my component code making it hard to read.
    - Breaking down the form into smaller components seemed unnecessary considering the small size of the project, but once I making functions for each input field change it made sense to do. Again because they were crowding the code.
    - I probably spent longer than I should have styling pixel perfect to how I envisioned, but it was a fun break when I got stuck on other areas of the app.
